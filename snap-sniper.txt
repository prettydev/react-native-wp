1. 1. Google Login is not working - Error: apiClient is null - call configure first

2. 2. Restore Password page does not show what information is required to reset password

10. 11. Lives Payments don’t work yet
	
**  Solved Facebook login

16. 17* Can we add a small bar on the side of the screen for Zooming as well? Sometimes zooming can be difficult. - This needs to be similar to how another sniper game works - small vertical slider with a bar on it that moves.  //not fixed


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. 3. Notifications never shows anything, sometimes it shows increased number but no notifications show on the screen

5. 5. Profile images are uploading blurry - We need to fix this

6. 7. Users shouldn’t have to login each time they open the app. We should remember the users profile and automatically log them in

20. 21* Push Notifications are not setup yet from what we can see.  //not fixed

21. 22* If a user is killed we need to send a push notification to them, then when they open the app, it shows the blood screen

22. 23* Random in-app notifications should be sent, saying things like, your area is getting popular, more players are nearby etc, etc. This can be on a random time schedule

14. 15. We must be able to send messages between users when they are killed, at the moment, the same screen appears to both users. No messages can be seen on the killed users end

19. 20* Secret Missions are supposed to randomly pop up on the screen (at least 1-2 times a week) - user should not have to click Accept a Mission to get a secret mission.  //not fixed



4. 4. Location always shows as Murray, App needs to be based on the users current location, the only time it will use the users Address is when they are within the 500m of that address, they go offline. If not, it must always use the users live location

15. 16* App doesn’t seem like it’s using Live Location still  //fixed






7. 8. Accept a Mission is not working still for me. If I click Accept a Mission, then I can see the last mission I had, my mission never ends, once I kill the user it should end so I can kill someone else, this doesn’t happen.

////// 8. 9. Create a group button still doesn’t work for me, it just reloads the same screen I’m on

////// 9. 10. World Ranking Locations show the users name in the location section, this needs to show Locations

11. 12. Missions are supposed to automatically appear instead of clicking a button to get a mission, Missions will be given to a user twice a week.

12. 13. When a user is killed, on the killed users screen, we need to show blood falling down the screen to indicate they’ve been killed, this is in the design

13. 14. When a user is killed, on the killed users screen, it shows their own profile picture, not the person who killed them

17. 18* Playing Live Assassin Mission Button doesn’t change from off  //that's why I blocked it. it will be on when you create assassin game

18. 19* Playing Live Pick a Target Assassinations button doesn’t change from off  //it will be on if you create a pick a target game
